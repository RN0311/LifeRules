## Life Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------
> This repo contains some of my life rules, which I shared with two most important people of my life, 
who completely transformed me! Made me a better person! I do really miss you, Ayush bhaia & Superman(A. Avi)! <br >
Love ya both a bunch! :heart: 

```Python 
Rule 1: This rule will help in re-wiring my brain from negative thoughts.Similar to brain-in-a-vat.
                str = " "
                str.replace(" I can't ", "I will do it")
                              


Rule 2: Let go off past. FULL STOP . Remove garbage from life. 
               import gc 
               gc.collect()


Rule 3:  Prioritize.Build "Locks" in life.No socializing if you can't handle.
               Pythread_type_lock
               Pythread_allocate_lock(void)
                {
                         ...
                         if(lock)
                               {
                                      status = sem_init(lock,0,1)
                                      CHECK_STATUS("Busy_Working")
                                }
                         ...
                 }
```
